<h2>Dueling Spaceships</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Battle your opponent to destroy their spaceship before they destroy you!
</li>


<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
    Instead of waiting to attack your opponent, players can attack at the same time.  Also instead of having three lives, there is now health for each oponent. Players can still move and shoot in any direction like in the physical prototype.
    </li>

<li><strong>Iteration Ideas</strong>
    For the iteration due next week I plan to add either more levels with obstacles such as asteroids or possibly power ups such as health and shield.
